    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Even if you're not a Spider-Man fan, you'll likely have heard rumours that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were reprising their roles for Spider-Man: No Way Home.

Since it was first reported back in December 2020, their supposed return has been speculated so much that it essentially became a fact – despite there actually being no confirmation from Sony, Marvel Studios or the actors involved.

In fact, everybody involved was insistent that Maguire and Garfield wouldn't be back as Peter Parker in the new movie. Garfield called a leaked set photo a fake, while Holland said in February 2021 that "they will not be appearing in this film".

That didn't stop the rumours though, with the likes of Holland and Garfield forced to repeatedly state that there would only be one Peter in No Way Home. Still though, fans thought that the second trailer, released in November 2021, was tricking fans by editing out the other two stars.

</p>
<p>In 2002 tobey Maguire starred in marvels SpiderMan. The film was a major success and made him into a star. He reprised the role in the sequels Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3, and has also provided the voice of Spider-Man for the video game adaptations of the films. All three movies went on to be part of the highest-grossing movies each year.

His performance as Spider-Man earned him some glowing reviews. Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune wrote that "with his big, round, soulful eyes, Maguire always has been able to convey a sense of wonder, and his instinct for understatement also serves him well here. Due to script and production complications, a proposed fourth Spider-Man movie did not materialize. Sony's Columbia Pictures decided to reboot the franchise. The film, titled The Amazing Spider-Man, was released on July 3, 2012, with a different actor, Andrew Garfield, playing the lead.</p>

<p>The Amazing Spider-Man is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man and sharing the title of the character's longest-running comic book series of the same name. It is the fourth theatrical Spider-Man film produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, a reboot of the series following Sam Raimi's 2002–2007 Spider-Man trilogy, and the first of the two The Amazing Spider-Man films. The film was directed by Marc Webb and written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves from a story by Vanderbilt, and stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell Scott, Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field. In the film, after Parker is bitten by a genetically altered spider, he gains newfound, spider-like powers and ventures out to save the city from the machinations of a mysterious reptilian foe</p>
<p>Andrew Russell Garfield is an American-born English actor.[2] An alumnus of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, he is the recipient of various accolades, including a Tony Award and a British Academy Television Award, in addition to receiving nominations for an Academy Award, a Laurence Olivier Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and three British Academy Film Awards.</p>
<p>tom holland is the latest Peter Parker in the 1st of toms current trilogy he fights crime under the alter ego of Spider-Man. Despite his best efforts to keep his identity secret from the world, he was found and recruited by Tony Stark, gaining a new suit and technology in exchange.Peter Parker forged a name for himself in New York City and became well-known as a local neighborhood hero, fighting against the Vulture, who is creating advanced weapons from stolen alien technology. After defeating Vulture, Peter discover the true responsibilities of a hero, so he decided to decline Stark's offer of membership in the Avengers in order to continue helping the little guy however he could.</p>
<p>A large part of Spider-Man: No Way Home’s hefty, long-running press tour has been about avoiding spoilers. It’s so crucial to the movie’s DNA that my screening of the film opened with a message from Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, and Jamie Foxx (Electro) pleading with all of us about to watch the movie: Don’t say anything about it until everyone else you know has seen it! Don’t ruin the surprise!

But even Marvel knows that it can only do so much as to protect the world from the inevitable leaking of casting details and plot twists. Batalon even joked about this, pointing out that Jamie Foxx’s appearance in the video was, itself, something of a spoiler—after all, No Way Home’s most surprising conceit is that it weaves every previous attempt at a Spider-Man cinematic universe into one movie. Jamie Foxx ain’t even from the MCU, so the fact that he’s here protesting spoilers should feel ironic.</p>
<p>nit was announced that Holland was cast as a teenage Peter Parker / Spider-Man, and his "life was flipped upside down", as he later tweeted, as part of a six-picture deal with Marvel Studios. As part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe , he first appeared as Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War. The film was a massive critical and commercial success, grossing over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2016, with Holland receiving critical praise</p>
